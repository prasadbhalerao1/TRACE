 * Covers the path every authenticated page depends on: sign in with the seeded demo
 * candidate, land on the role hub, and reach the dashboard with its navigation intact.
 *
 * Auth is self-hosted (bcrypt + HS256 JWT issued by this API), so the test drives the
 * app's own /sign-in form directly. An earlier version of this file drove a hosted
 * Clerk <SignIn/> widget and imported @clerk/testing — a provider this project does
 * not use and a package that is not in package.json, so the suite could not even
 * import, let alone run.
 *
 * Credentials default to the seeded demo candidate (scripts/seed_db.py). Override via
 * apps/web/.env.test if you seeded something else.
