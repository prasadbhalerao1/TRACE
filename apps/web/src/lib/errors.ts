/** Shared classification of API failures, and the messages users actually see.
 *
 * Two problems this solves.
 *
 * First, retry decisions were made by pattern-matching status codes in the error string,
 * and every LLM failure used to arrive as the same 503 — so the client retried all of
 * them. Three are not retryable: an exhausted provider quota and a missing API key do not
 * resolve by waiting, and a retry loop against them just spends the user's time on a
 * guaranteed failure before showing the same error. The backend now sends a `code` and an
 * explicit `retryable` flag (see `_LLM_ERROR_RESPONSES` in services/api/main.py); this
 * module reads them, falling back to status-code heuristics for endpoints that predate
 * the typed responses.
 *
 * Second, `isTransient` existed in two files with subtly different implementations, and a
 * hand-inlined copy of the backoff formula lived in a third. One definition here.
