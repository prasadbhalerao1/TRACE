/** Client wrapper that keeps recharts out of the public portfolio's initial payload.
 *
 * `/[username]` is a Server Component with a stated Lighthouse >= 90 target, and it
 * imported this chart statically — so every visitor downloaded recharts before the page
 * could become interactive, for one below-the-fold graph. A Server Component cannot call
 * `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` itself, hence this thin client boundary.
 *
 * The fallback reserves the chart's real height, so deferring it costs no layout shift.
