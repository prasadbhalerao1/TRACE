 *
 * The five workspace layouts redirect here whenever `me.onboarding_required` is true,
 * so putting this route inside one of them would redirect to itself. It also has no
 * sidebar by design — there is nothing to navigate to until the profile exists.
 *
 * The wizard reads `?github=` via useSearchParams to resume after an OAuth round trip,
 * which requires a Suspense boundary above it.
