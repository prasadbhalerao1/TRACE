"""Supervisor graph — minimal demo per doc/multi-agent-architecture/07 §2, dispatching a
raw NL request to real Module 01 (Candidate Intelligence) and Module 02 (Recruitment)
logic in-process. Proves the supervisor pattern end-to-end for 2 of the 4 modules that
exist so far — see `state.py`'s docstring for why this doesn't cover all 6.

Two things doc 07 §2's example code assumes that this codebase does NOT actually have —
built around them here, not silently "fixed" (both logged in `.agents/decisions.md`):

1. `builder.compile(checkpointer=postgres_checkpointer)` — no module in this codebase uses
   a LangGraph checkpointer. Module 02's Recruiter Copilot and Module 03's Interview
   Agent both persist state to DB columns manually instead (see `.agents/decisions.md`'s
   Module 02/03 entries). Compiled without one here too, as a module-level `get_graph()`
   singleton — same pattern as `services/agents/candidate_intelligence/graph.py`.
2. Each module's real entry point is a REST router step (fetch DB context -> build state
   -> invoke its own subgraph -> persist -> respond), not a bare importable subgraph this
   supervisor can `ainvoke()` and expect DB I/O to already be done. This supervisor's
   per-module nodes instead call the exact service functions the routers themselves call
   (`services.api.routers.candidates._to_score_response`,
   `services.api.routers.recruitment._run_matching_and_persist`) — doing real DB reads/
   writes, not a mock. The live `AsyncSession` is threaded through via
   `RunnableConfig.configurable["db"]` (LangGraph's supported per-invocation context
   mechanism) rather than through `SupervisorState` itself, since a plain state dict
   isn't the right place to carry a live DB session object across a module-level singleton
   graph shared by concurrent requests.
