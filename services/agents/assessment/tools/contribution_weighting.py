"""Contribution Weighting Agent — FR-3.2, doc 03 §7's exact formula:

    contribution_share(member) = normalize(
        0.35 * lines_changed_that_survive_to_HEAD
      + 0.25 * commits_count
      + 0.20 * PRs_opened_and_merged
      + 0.20 * PR_reviews_given
    )

Rules only (the share itself) plus an optional Haiku narrative summary. Implementation
detail not specified by the doc: each raw component is first min-max scaled against the
team's own max for that component (0-1) before the weights are applied — otherwise
`lines_survived` (often hundreds) would numerically dominate `commits_count` (often
single digits) regardless of the stated weights, making them meaningless. Final shares
are then normalized to sum to 1 across the team, per the formula's own "normalize(...)".
The report always includes the raw components alongside the share (doc 03 §7), so a
recruiter can see exactly why.
