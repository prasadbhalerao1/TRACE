"""Ranking Aggregation Agent — doc 05 §4, "rules (weighted formula, transparent)".
Node contract: constraints.md §2.3. Joins `repo_scores` (from `repo_deck_linking`) with
`novelty_scores` (from `cross_event_novelty`) and each team's pre-fetched `judge_score`/
`pitch_score` into the doc 08 §8 composite formula, then ranks. Teams with no computable
composite (every component N/A — e.g. no judge score, no deck, no repo) sort last and are
still included with `composite_score: None`, never silently dropped.
