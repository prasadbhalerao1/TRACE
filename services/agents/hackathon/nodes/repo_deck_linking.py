"""Repo/Deck Linking Agent — doc 05 §4, "rules" tier, "validates/dedupes references,
triggers async invocation of doc 03/04 pipelines."

Decks are NOT re-scored here: a team's deck is uploaded through Module 04's own real
`POST /presentations/upload` endpoint before/at hackathon submission time, so
`presentation_scores` already exists by the time rankings are finalized — the router
pre-fetches `pitch_score` (a plain table read) and this node just passes it through.

Repos ARE actively triggered here, since a hackathon repo link never goes through Module
03's own coding-assessment UI — this node invokes Module 03's real, unmodified
verification graph (`get_verification_graph()`, the exact entrypoint
`services/api/modules/assessments/router.py` itself calls) for any team whose repo hasn't been
scored yet. Reuses `_fetch_repo_sample_source` from that same router rather than
duplicating the GitHub-fetch logic.

Node stays DB-free (this codebase's universal convention — router fetches/persists,
nodes stay pure): the freshly-computed `repo_verification_results` are handed back in
state for the router to persist as real `Assessment`/`Submission` rows after this graph
completes, exactly like every other cross-module write in this codebase.
