"""Normalization Agent — doc 05 §4, "Haiku (schema mapping) + rules". Only used for
webhook ingestion (FR-7b): a platform push has no human in the loop to confirm field
mapping, unlike CSV import where the organizer already resolves ambiguous columns in the
client-side SheetJS preview grid before submitting the already-structured
`CSVImportRequest` (doc 05 §8's `CSVImportPreview.tsx`) — so CSV rows need no server-side
normalization pass, only validation.

Rules-first: a small synonym table covers the field-name variance actually documented
across Devpost/Devfolio-style payloads (doc 05 §2). Haiku is only invoked as a fallback
when the raw payload's keys don't match any known synonym for a required field — schema
mapping is a low-stakes extraction task, squarely Haiku-tier per constraints.md §5's
model-routing policy, never Sonnet.
