"""Project Quality & Innovation — the two sub-scores doc 01 §4 routes to Sonnet.

Both are "Mixed"/"Subjective": a mechanical component that always runs, plus an
LLM/embedding component that calls out to Anthropic/the embedding model for real and
degrades to `None` (never a fabricated number) if that dependency isn't reachable —
whether because a key is missing or the service/model isn't available in this
environment. Doc 08 §1.1's cold-start re-normalization is what absorbs that gracefully.
