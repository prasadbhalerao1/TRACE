"""Skill Gap Analysis — FR-4.1. Embeds the candidate's skill set, compares it against
embedded requirement sets for target roles via Qdrant similarity search, and returns a
ranked gap list (biggest gap first). Implements doc/SRS/01 §7's exact method: cosine
similarity between the candidate's skill-embedding **centroid** and each target-role
embedding decides which role to target (when the candidate didn't pick one); a role
skill is then a gap when its embedding similarity to the candidate's skills is below
threshold AND there's no direct (literal) match in the candidate's skill list.

Real Qdrant + sentence-transformers integration, same "write the real integration code,
raise a clear typed error rather than fabricate" convention as
`tools/resume.py`'s `ResumeExtractionUnavailable` / `services/api/core/storage.py`'s
`StorageUnavailable`. Unlike the Talent Score's cold-start degrade-to-`None` (which is
fine because a sub-score is one of seven inputs to a re-normalized sum), Qdrant being
unreachable here means FR-4.1's entire output is missing, so it's a hard error, not a
silent partial result.
