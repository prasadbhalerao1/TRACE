"""Perplexity Heuristic Agent — doc 06 §4, "statistical tool, shared approach with doc
04's AI-content agent". FR-3.

Per the assignment file's explicit instruction ("read `services/agents/ppt_analyzer/` for
the exact method before reimplementing... so the two don't diverge in method"), this
reuses `ppt_analyzer/tools/ai_content_heuristic.py`'s private per-text scoring function
directly rather than re-deriving the burstiness/lexical-diversity formula a second time —
the two detectors must agree on what "AI-generated-sounding text" means. Only the
aggregation across sections (a resume's summary/experience bullets, vs. a deck's slides)
differs, since the input shape differs (free text sections vs. slide dicts)."""
