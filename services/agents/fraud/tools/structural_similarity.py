"""Structural Similarity Agent — doc 06 §4, "tool only" (`copydetect`, a Dolos-style
token-based structural clone detector — doc 08 §3's canonical algorithm, "robust to
variable renaming, unlike raw text diff"). Shared logic for FR-2 (project plagiarism)
and FR-5 (Module 03 submission plagiarism) — both compare one piece of source code
against a corpus of other candidates' code.

`copydetect` was not pre-installed in this repo's venv (confirmed via import check
before adding it — same "check first" step this session confirmed `radon`/`lizard`/
`bandit` already existed for Module 03); installed via `uv pip install --python
services/api/.venv copydetect`, matching the pattern the assignment file names.
