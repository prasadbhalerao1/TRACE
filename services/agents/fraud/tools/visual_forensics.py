"""Visual Forensics Agent — doc 06 §4, "Haiku + vision... outputs low/medium/high
suspicion, never certainty". Runs only when Issuer Lookup found no verification URL/API
for this issuer (doc 06 §4's Certificate Verification subgraph).

Rules-first (OCR confidence + metadata completeness — cheap, always available, no
network dependency), with an OPTIONAL Haiku vision pass over the certificate image when
one exists (`File.public_url`) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured, matching this
codebase's established "LLM call is a best-effort enhancement layered on a working
rules baseline, never the only path" pattern (e.g. `ppt_analyzer/tools/plagiarism.py`'s
"Haiku for narrative is optional UI-copy enhancement"). Never outputs certainty — always
one of low/medium/high suspicion, per the hard constraint in doc 06 §4/§8.
