"""Authenticity Aggregation Agent — doc 06 §4, "rules (transparent weighted formula)".
FR-6. Formula is doc 08 §10's explicit canonical version — copied verbatim, not
reinvented:

    AuthenticityScore = max(0, 100 - sum(penalty_k * 1[flag_k.status == 'upheld']))

Only `upheld` flags count — a `raised` flag sitting in the review queue has ZERO effect,
per doc 06 §7/§8's binding "fraud flags never silently affect a score" rule. This
function is pure (no DB access) — the router fetches the candidate's `upheld` flags and
passes them in, then persists the result as a new `authenticity_scores` row.
