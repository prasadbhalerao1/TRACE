"""The three LLM-backed steps of the Recruiter Copilot (FR-3): Query Understanding,
Re-ranking, and Explanation. Routed through `services.api.core.llm.generate_structured`
(same pattern as `assessment/tools/llm_review.py`) — a JSON-schema parameters object,
`RecruitmentUnavailable` raised (never a silent fallback) when the configured provider
is unavailable or the call fails.

Per doc/multi-agent-architecture/02 §4 and the `langgraph-agents` skill's explicit
warning: the Query Understanding Agent must "reject and re-prompt on schema-validation
failure, never silently accept a malformed filter" — implemented here as a single
corrective retry (not an unbounded loop) before raising, since Anthropic's forced
tool-use already makes most schema failures rare.
