"""Hybrid Search execution — FR-3.2/3.3, "tool call, no LLM" per the agent registry. Node
contract: constraints.md §2.3.

Applies `search_plan`'s hard filters to the pre-fetched `candidate_pool` (deterministic,
zero-cost step per doc 02 §2), then — only if there's residual `semantic_query` text —
ranks the survivors by embedding similarity via `embeddings.candidate_skill_centroid`, the
same centroid technique Module 01 uses for role matching. Bounds the output to the top ~50
candidates, which is what keeps the downstream Sonnet re-rank cost-bounded (doc 02 §2's
"LLM only on the final shortlist" rule).
