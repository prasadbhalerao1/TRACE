"""Summary & Suggestions Agent — doc 04 §4 (FR-7/FR-8). Node contract: constraints.md §2.3.

FR-8 requires suggestions "grounded in the specific rubric gaps found" — those gaps are
collected directly from the 3 scoring agents' structured output regardless of whether
the LLM summary call itself succeeds, so suggestions still populate even when
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing (rule-based fallback: surface the raw gaps verbatim,
never fabricate advice that isn't grounded in an actual finding).
