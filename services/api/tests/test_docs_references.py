"""Documentation must not point at files that no longer exist.

The docs are dense with `path/to/file.py` references, and they are the main way someone
navigates from "what does this do" to the code. When a module moves, the reference rots
silently — nothing fails, and the next reader is sent to a file that isn't there.

A sweep in 2026-08 found 32 broken references: modules that moved between `tools/` and
`nodes/`, a graph renamed `graph.py` -> `matching_graph.py`, a node
(`topic_planning.py`) that never existed, a migration folded into the squashed baseline,
and a whole package (`packages/prompts/`) that had been deleted.

This also guards `.agents/decisions.md`, which 37 source files cite as the record of why
the architecture is shaped the way it is — and which had gone missing entirely, so every
one of those pointers dead-ended.
