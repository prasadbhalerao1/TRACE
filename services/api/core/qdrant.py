"""Qdrant client construction — shared by every module that does vector search (Job
Matching/Copilot, Talent Score innovation-novelty, Career Guidance skill-gap, PPT
Analyzer plagiarism/cross-event-novelty). Previously each module hand-rolled its own
"connect, verify with get_collections(), wrap the exception" logic; consolidated here
since all four copies were byte-for-byte identical except for how they signal failure.

Two failure conventions coexist across call sites and both are preserved exactly:
- Some callers (recruitment matching, skill-gap) want a hard failure — Qdrant being
  unreachable means the whole feature has no output, so a typed exception should
  propagate and become a 503, never a fabricated score.
- Others (innovation novelty, plagiarism) treat Qdrant as one optional signal among
  several — Qdrant being unreachable should cold-start-degrade (return `None`/skip),
  not take down the whole request.
`raise_on_unavailable` picks between the two without duplicating the connection logic.

# The connected client is a process-level singleton, for the same reason `get_embedder()`

# httpx connection pool — and then immediately spend a round trip on `get_collections()`
# purely to prove reachability. On the matching path (`job_embed` then
# `project_relevance`) that was two throwaway pools and two wasted round trips per run.
#
# Reachability is therefore verified once, on first construction. A Qdrant that dies
# later surfaces as an error from the actual search call, which every caller already
# handles — the health-check probe never protected against that anyway, since Qdrant
# could always drop between the probe and the real query.

    today (`candidate_id` on project embeddings, `presentation_id` on slides, `role` on
    the skill taxonomy), so each one pays that scan — and the cost grows with total
    collection size rather than with the size of the matching subset. That is precisely
    the shape of "it was fast in dev and crawls once real data lands".

    Idempotent and best-effort: creating an index that already exists is a no-op error we
