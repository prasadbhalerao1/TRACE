"""Cross-module event consumer — the `events` table's only consumer-side implementation
so far (`packages/db/models/event.py`; Module 05's `finalize_rankings` endpoint in
`services/api/routers/hackathons.py` is the only publisher, per
`.agents/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-30 Phase 2 entry).

Two responsibilities, deliberately separated:

1. `process_pending_events` — bookkeeping. Marks unprocessed `hackathon.rankings.finalized`
   rows as handled (`processed_at`). This is idempotent-safe housekeeping, not the source
   of truth for what a recruiter's feed shows.
2. `get_matching_top_performers_for_recruiter` — the actual matching logic, computed LIVE
   from `hackathon_rankings` + `hackathon_team_members` + `candidate_profiles` +
   `recruiter_watchlists` at read time, not from a persisted match table. Chosen over
   persisting matches for the same reason Module 05's own `top-performers-feed` endpoint
   already reads rankings live: a recruiter's watchlist can be created *after* an event
   was published (or edited afterward), so a match computed only at event-processing time
   would go stale or miss it. Computing live off tables that already exist means a
   recruiter always sees a feed consistent with their *current* watchlist criteria and
   *all* finalized rankings, not just ones processed after their watchlist existed. This
   also avoids a new table per the assignment's explicit preference ("prefer computing
   live... unless there's a clear reason not to" — there isn't one here).

No task queue (Celery/Arq) — this repo doesn't use one for anything yet. A simple polling
loop is enough for a hackathon-scoped demo; see `run_polling_loop` and its
`.agents/decisions.md` entry for why a fixed-interval `asyncio` loop was chosen over
Celery/Arq/webhooks.
