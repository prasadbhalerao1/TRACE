"""Fixed-window rate-limit middleware, Redis-backed with an in-memory fallback.

Counters live in Redis when it is reachable, so the limit is enforced across every API
process. The original implementation was purely in-process, which meant the effective
limit was `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE x number_of_workers` — running uvicorn with 4 workers
silently quadrupled it — and every counter reset on restart. Redis is now a first-class
dependency of this app (it backs the arq job queue), so there is no longer a reason to
avoid it here; this reuses the queue's existing connection pool rather than opening a
second one.

When Redis is unavailable the middleware degrades to the in-process counter rather than
failing open or rejecting traffic: a rate limiter that 500s is worse than one that is
merely per-process. The fallback is bounded (see `_MAX_TRACKED_BUCKETS`) — the previous
`defaultdict` grew forever, one permanent entry per distinct client IP, which is a slow
memory leak on any internet-facing deployment.

Keyed by authenticated user id when a bearer token is present (best-effort, never raises
— this middleware must not become a second, competing auth gate; `rbac.py`'s
`get_current_user` dependency remains the single source of truth for authorization),
falling back to client IP for unauthenticated requests. `/health` is exempt so uptime
checks never 429.
