# DataAxle Platform Documentation

This directory contains the complete technical documentation for the DataAxle AI hiring and
hackathon platform, organized by module. Each doc is written as if explaining the system in
a technical interview — confident, precise, focused on *why* decisions were made, and honest
about what's unfinished or scoped out.

## Documentation files

0. **[00-architecture-overview.md](00-architecture-overview.md)** — Start here. System
   diagram, full tech stack, repo structure, agent/database inventories, and an honest
   statement of current deployment status (local dev only, no committed deploy manifest).

1. **[01-authentication-and-rbac.md](01-authentication-and-rbac.md)** — Custom
   email+password auth, JWT issuance/verification, server-side role enforcement via
   `require_role`, and the in-memory rate limiter.

2. **[02-candidate-intelligence-and-talent-score.md](02-candidate-intelligence-and-talent-score.md)** —
   The AI Talent Profile Engine and the 9-dimensional Talent Score: resume parsing, GitHub

3. **[03-resume-portfolio-and-career-guidance.md](03-resume-portfolio-and-career-guidance.md)** —
   Resume/cover-letter generation with a fact-check guardrail, public portfolio pages, and
   career guidance (skill gaps, salary prediction, learning paths).

4. **[04-recruitment-matching-and-copilot.md](04-recruitment-matching-and-copilot.md)** —
   The job-matching formula (skill overlap, semantic similarity, experience, Talent Score)
   and the natural-language Recruiter Copilot.

5. **[05-skill-verification-and-assessments.md](05-skill-verification-and-assessments.md)** —
   Coding assessments, MCQ tests, project analysis, and hackathon team contribution
   attribution via git commit analysis.

6. **[06-ai-interview-agent.md](06-ai-interview-agent.md)** — Turn-based, conditionally
   routed AI interviews with live scoring and a structured final report.

7. **[07-ppt-pitch-deck-analyzer.md](07-ppt-pitch-deck-analyzer.md)** — Pitch deck rubric
   scoring, plagiarism/novelty detection, and background-task-based analysis.

8. **[08-hackathon-to-hiring-pipeline.md](08-hackathon-to-hiring-pipeline.md)** — Team
   ranking (judge + pitch + repo + novelty), and event-driven, live-computed recruiter
   matching against hackathon top performers.

9. **[09-trust-and-fraud-prevention.md](09-trust-and-fraud-prevention.md)** — The platform's
   most detailed module: certificate verification, plagiarism detection, duplicate profile
   detection, AI-content signals, the trusted issuer registry, and the core "flags never
   auto-affect scoring" principle.

10. **[10-multi-agent-architecture.md](10-multi-agent-architecture.md)** — The 12-graph,
    7-module LangGraph architecture; the supervisor's real (deliberately partial) scope; the
    DB-free node convention; a worked conditional-routing example.

11. **[11-vector-search-and-llm-gateway.md](11-vector-search-and-llm-gateway.md)** — The
    shared AI infrastructure: Qdrant collections, the bare-vs-described skill embedding
    discovery, the multi-provider LLM gateway, failure modes, and performance
    characteristics.

12. **[12-ui-design-system.md](12-ui-design-system.md)** — Design philosophy and the actual
    frontend library stack (Tailwind 4, shadcn, framer-motion, recharts, @dnd-kit,
    @monaco-editor/react).

13. **[13-role-flows-and-use-cases.md](13-role-flows-and-use-cases.md)** — Plain-English
    step-by-step flows and use cases for each of the five roles: Candidate, Recruiter,
    Organizer, Judge, Admin.

14. **[14-prompts-architecture.md](14-prompts-architecture.md)** — The markdown-based prompt
    system: per-module `prompts/` directories, the `load_prompt()` loader, and how to add a
    new prompt.

15. **[15-local-development-setup.md](15-local-development-setup.md)** — How to actually run
    this locally: `dev-up.ps1`, service URLs, infrastructure (Postgres/Redis/Qdrant), and
    secrets setup for every real integration (Anthropic, GitHub OAuth, Cloudinary, Langfuse,
    Sentry).

## Key architectural insights

### The "bare skill name vs described embedding" discovery
Bare embeddings ("Vue.js" embed ≈ "Photoshop" embed when compared to React) are ambiguous.
Adding one-sentence descriptions per skill ("Vue.js: progressive JS framework...") fixes
this to 0.89 (Vue/React) vs 0.66 (Photoshop/React) — measured and tuned. Used across job
matching, skill gap analysis, and hard-filter fallback. See doc 11.

### Cold-start renormalization pattern
Used across Talent Score, Pitch Score, Hackathon Ranking, Job Matching, and Coding Ability.
When a component is missing, drop it and renormalize remaining weights to sum to 1.0. Never
fabricate a 0.0. Consolidated into one shared `weighted_renormalized_mean()` helper. See
docs 02, 08, and 11.

### Fraud engine's "flags never auto-affect" principle
Raised flags have zero impact on scoring or visibility. Only human-upheld flags (with
non-null review notes and evidence) contribute penalties — enforced at the database layer
(`NOT NULL` constraints), not just code convention. See doc 09.

### Event-driven recruiter matching (not pre-computed)
Hackathon rankings finalize → an event is published. When a recruiter later creates a
watchlist, they're polled against the event and matched live at poll time, not from a
pre-computed table — this catches recruiters who add a watchlist after the event finalized.
Tradeoff: ~5 second polling latency vs. correctness. See doc 08.

### Background tasks for long-running AI analysis
Pitch deck analysis and candidate ingestion used to block HTTP requests for 15–40+ seconds
with no progress feedback. Both now run as FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`, returning immediately
with a `processing` status while the frontend polls for completion. See docs 02 and 07. (Note:
this is in-process background work, not a distributed task queue — see doc 00's "Task queue"
note for the honest scope of what's actually running.)

## How to read this documentation

**For understanding the full system**: Start with doc 00 (Architecture Overview) for the
big picture, then doc 10 (Multi-Agent Architecture) for the orchestration model, then doc 09
(Trust & Fraud Prevention) for the most detailed single module.

**For a specific feature**: Use the table of contents above to jump straight to the module
you care about.

**For implementation details**: Each doc includes file paths and line numbers. Use them to
navigate the actual codebase.

**For architectural decisions**: Every "Key design decisions" section explains trade-offs,
constraints, and honest limitations — including where something is a deliberate scope
choice rather than an unfinished feature.

## Document status

- 16 files total: this README plus 00 through 15.
- All auth-related content reflects the current custom email+password/JWT system — no
  references to any third-party identity provider in the live auth path.
- All file:line references were checked against the current codebase at the time of writing.
