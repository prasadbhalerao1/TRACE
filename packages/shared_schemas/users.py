# Roles a visitor may assign themselves at `POST /auth/signup`. Everything outside this
# set — `admin`, `organizer`, `judge` — is granted only by an existing admin through
# `PATCH /admin/users/{id}/role`.
#
# `SignupRequest.role` used to be the full `Role` enum, taken straight from the request
# body into `User(role=...)`. Since `Role` includes `admin`, anyone could POST
# `{"role": "admin"}` and receive a token that opened user management, role reassignment
# for every account, the audit log and the trusted-issuer registry. That made every
# `require_role` check in the codebase decorative: each one gated on a role the caller
# had picked for themselves. The signup form offered the choice outright.
#
# MUST stay in sync with SIGNUP_ROLES in apps/web/src/lib/constants.ts, which is what the
# form renders; tests/test_signup_roles.py asserts the two agree.
